Hi all, I want to build an all in one data ingestion, analytics, API, and webapp development 
environment. The idea here is that you can ingest data from your own edge devices, process 
it, store it, analyze it, and the share it with the world via API or a webapp. The main 
architectural concern here is that a single developer can build a complete end to end AI 
based application that can be deployed on prem(computer at home) or in a cloud environment.

If you are interested in help building this, please reach out.

Michel.
